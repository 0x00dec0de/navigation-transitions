# The problem

If you want to transition between pages, your current option is to fetch the new page with JavaScript, update the URL with `pushState`, and animate between the two.

Having to reimplement all of navigation for a simple transition is a large task. This proposal provides a low-level way to create transitions while maintaining regular browser navigation.

# Goals

* Enable complex transitions
* Allow transitions to start while the next page is being fetched
* Allow transisitions to differ between link-clicking, back button, forward button, reload button
* Allow transitions to cater for a non-zero scroll position in the navigated-to page

# API sketch

```js
window.addEventListener('navigate', event => {
  // â€¦
});
```

The above event fires when the document is being navigated in a way that would replace the current document.

* `event.type` - One of the following strings:
  * `back` - User is navigating back.
  * `forward` - User is navigating forward.
  * `reload` - Reload-triggered navigation.
  * `normal` - Not one of the above.
* `event.url` - The URL being navigated to.
* `event.window` - A promise for a `WindowProxy` being navigated to, unless the navigation is cross-origin or fails.
* `event.waitUntil(promise)` - Keep this document alive and potentially visible until promise settles.

# Simple cross-fade transition

```js
window.addEventListener('navigate', event => {
  event.waitUntil(
    event.window.then(newWin => {
      if (!newWin) return;

      // assuming newWin.document.interactive means DOM ready
      return newWin.document.interactive.then(() => {
        return newWin.document.documentElement
          .animate({opacity: 0}, 1000).finished
      });
    })
  );
});
```

# Slide in/out transition

```js
window.addEventListener('navigate', event => {
  if (event.type == 'reload') return;

  const fromRight = [
    {transform: 'translate(100%, 0)'},
    {transform: 'none'}
  ];

  const toLeft = [
    {transform: 'none'},
    {transform: 'translate(-100%, 0)'}
  ];

  const fromLeft = toLeft.slice().reverse();
  const toRight = fromRight.slice().reverse();

  event.waitUntil(
    event.window.then(newWin => {
      if (!newWin) return;
 
      return newWin.document.interactive.then(() => {
        return Promise.all([
          newWin.document.documentElement.animate(
            event.type == 'back' ? fromLeft : fromRight
          ).finished,
          newWin.document.documentElement.animate(
            event.type == 'back' ? toLeft : toRight
          ).finished
        ]);
      });
    })
  );
});
```

# Rendering

During the transition, the new document will be rendered on top of the current one. If the background of html/body is transparent, the old document will be visible through it.

During the transition, the render-box of the new document will be limited to the viewport size. This means `html { transform: translate(0, -20px); }` on the new document will leave a 20 pixel gap at the bottom. though which the current document will be visible. After the transition, rendering would switch back to the regular model.

Lots of hand-waving right now.

# Place within the navigation algorithm

Feels like the event should fire just after step 10 of [navigate](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#navigate). If `waitUntil` is called, the browser would consider the pages to be transitioning.

The rest of the handling would likely be in the ["update the session history with the new page" algorithm](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#update-the-session-history-with-the-new-page). Where the unloading of the current document would be delayed without delaying the loading of the new document.

Yep, more hand-waving.

# Potential issues & questions

* Can animations be reliably syncronised between documents? They at least share an event loop.
* Any issues firing this for nested contexts?
* What if the promise passed to `waitUntil` never resolves? Feels like it should have a timeout.
* What happens on low-end devices that can't display two documents at once?
* What if the navigation is cancelled? Eg `Content-Disposition` response. `event.window` could also cancel.
* How does this interact with browsers that have a bf cache?
